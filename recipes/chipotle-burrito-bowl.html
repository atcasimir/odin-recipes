    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>Chipotle style burrito bowl with a bed of grains, sizable protein portions of ground beef, veggies, sour cream
        topping, and additionally garnishes.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb. ground beef, 80/20 or 93/7 ratio; meat/fat</li>
        <li>1 cup white rice</li>
        <li>1 whole yellow onion</li>
        <li>Sour cream, amount is preference</li>
        <li>1 tbsp. garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 tbsp. onion powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tbsp. paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 tbsp. salt</li>
        <li>1/2 tbsp. pepper</li>
        <li>Ready fresh (no cooking required) greens of choice, e.g. lettuce, cucumber, spinach, etc.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>First begin by placing the rinsed rice into a crock pot with 1 and 3/4 cup water. Select
            &ldquo;rice/grain&rdquo;, and then &ldquo;Enter&rdquo;.</li>
        <li>Now chop up the onion into with the grain slices, so you end up with long slices of the onions natural
            structure.</li>
        <li>Heat up 1 fairly large for the beef and 1 medium sized for the onion with oil.</li>
        <li>Transfer the onion to the oiled pan and set on medium and cover with a lid.</li>
        <li>Place the beef into the larger pan and begin smashing with a large plastic/wood spoon to separate the meat
            into smaller pieces</li>
        <li>Periodically check on the onion to ensure it isn't burning or getting too cooked, ideally a nice
            golden/yellow color is perfect, potentially a little browning if preferred.</li>
        <li>After the beef has cooked for a few minutes, add in the spices and stir well. The beef will need more time
            to continue cooking off the fat.</li>
        <li>The onions should be close to finished if their colored has reached the golden yellow established
            previously, if they are at this point, remove the pan from the heat.</li>
        <li>Continue cooking the beef until there is no more pink meat present, and a nice browning has formed on a
            majority of the beef.</li>
    </ol>
