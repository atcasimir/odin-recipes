    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>This is one of my favorite meals! It is my go to whenever I can&rsquo;t decide on what to cook. It is a simple
        buttered noodles and hot italian sausage meal, topped with freshly grated genuine parmesan.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3-5 Hot Italian Sausages from Kroger</li>
        <li>1 box DeCecco no. 34 spiral noodles</li>
        <li>1 tsp. olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tsp. salted/unsalted butter</li>
        <li>Genuine Parmesan wedge</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Begin with filling a pot with water and salting to taste, and place on burner to begin boiling.</li>
        <li>While the water is boiling, place the italian sausage in a pan on medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Let the sausage brown and form a good crust no both sides, and then slightly brown the inner and
            outer-curved side of the sausage link if the water is still not boiling yet.</li>
        <li>Once the water is boiling, throw in pasta and turn down the heat so the water doesn't boil over the edge.
            The pasta should finish cooking in roughly 10-13 minutes</li>
        <li>With the pasta cooking, put about a half-cup of water in the pan with the sausage to begin steaming. Turn
            the heat up to max and place a lid on to trap the steam.</li>
        <li>Occasionally stir the pasta to keep the foam from boiling over, and check the sausage periodically.</li>
        <li>When the water in the sausage pan boils down, pour in another half-cup to continue steaming. The pasta
            should be about half done by now.</li>
        <li>Continue to check both pasta and sausage, when the second steaming is done (all the water is boiled away),
            the pasta should be finished as well.</li>
        <li>With the pasta complete, drain it through a strainer, and turn off all of the burners.</li>
        <li>Plate the pasta in a bowl, and the sausage on a plate. From here, put a teaspoon of oil, butter, and salt
            into the pasta, then shred some fresh parmesan onto the pasta and sausages.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Voila, your meal is complete!</p>
