    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>These are the fluffiest, most perfect eggs ever. They are complemented by the spring onion garnish which provides
        that additional onion bite to really assist in the eggy flavor that a lot of people get overwhelmed by easily.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tbl. heavy cream</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 spring onion/scallion</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Hot sauce of choice if preferred</li>
        <li>Small pad of butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Begin by cracking the eggs into a decent sized bowl, making sure to not get any shells in the bowl as well.
        </li>
        <li>Pour in the tbl. of heavy cream, or even less depending on how fluffy you want the eggs.</li>
        <li>Beat the eggs with a fork very adamantly until they are very bubbly and frothy. The more air bubbles, the
            more fluffy the eggs.</li>
        <li>Set a pan on a medium-low burner with the butter to begin heating it up.</li>
        <li>Once the butter begins to bubble and sizzle, the eggs are ready to be put into the pan.</li>
        <li>With eggs now cooking, slowly push a spatula around the eggs of the egg to slowly peel it away from the pan,
            eventually going around the entire perimeter of the egg. As it continues to cook, more and more of a cooked
            egg mass should form.</li>
        <li>The entire point of this process it to continually get air into the egg and prevent it from cooking as one
            solid mass.</li>
        <li>When the center of the eggs begin to turn more opaque, meaning less see through, you can start to scrape the
            egg from the bottom of the pan with the spatula.</li>
        <li>Continuing this process until the egg is fully cooked with an almost slight wet look to it, you will now
            have the fluffiest eggs in the whole world.</li>
        <li>Last but not least, sprinkle a hot sauce of choice, and cut the spring onion over the eggs with a pair of
            scissors and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
