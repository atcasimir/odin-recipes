# odin-recipes

Practice project from The Odin Project

This project is an opportunity to reinforace all of my HTML skills learned so far. The project is based on GitHub so it will be a great opportunity to practice using Git as well, another very essential skill. I will return to the README to update it after completing the project. I am not 100% what skills exactly I'll be using, so that is the reason for the post-reflection.
